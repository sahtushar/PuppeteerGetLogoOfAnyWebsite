# PuppeteerGetLogoOfAnyWebsite
This code has used jQuery and Puppeteer to crawl any website and get the brand(company) logo. This code is very efficient (not 100%) and uses similarity index to find the logo image source.

Just create a Node.js project, run `npm install puppeteer` and then run the file `node logo.js`.
